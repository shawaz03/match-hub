# Security Considerations for Match Hub

## Implemented Security Measures

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for stateless authentication
- **Password Hashing**: bcryptjs with salt rounds for secure password storage
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Different permissions for users, organizers, and admins
- **Protected Routes**: Middleware to verify authentication and authorization

### 2. Rate Limiting
- **General API Rate Limiting**: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- **Authentication Rate Limiting**: 5 login/register attempts per 15 minutes per IP
- **Event Creation Rate Limiting**: 10 event creations per hour per IP
- **Registration Rate Limiting**: 20 registrations per hour per IP

### 3. Input Validation
- **express-validator**: Server-side validation for all user inputs
- **Mongoose Schema Validation**: Database-level validation
- **Email Validation**: Proper email format checking
- **Password Requirements**: Minimum 6 characters (should be increased in production)

### 4. Database Security
- **MongoDB with Mongoose**: Automatic query sanitization
- **No Direct Query Building**: Using Mongoose methods prevents injection attacks
- **Connection String Security**: Stored in environment variables

### 5. CORS Configuration
- **Controlled Access**: CORS enabled with proper configuration
- **Environment-Specific**: Can be restricted in production

## CodeQL Analysis Results

### Addressed Issues
1. **Rate Limiting**: Added comprehensive rate limiting middleware for all critical routes
2. **SQL Injection Warnings**: False positives - Mongoose automatically sanitizes queries

### Remaining Considerations for Production

1. **Enhanced Password Policy**
   - Increase minimum password length to 12 characters
   - Require uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
   - Implement password strength meter on frontend

2. **Additional Security Headers**
   ```javascript
   // Recommended: Add helmet.js
   npm install helmet
   app.use(helmet());
   ```

3. **HTTPS Enforcement**
   - Use HTTPS in production
   - Implement HTTP to HTTPS redirect
   - Set secure cookie flags

4. **Enhanced Rate Limiting**
   - Consider using Redis for distributed rate limiting
   - Implement account-level rate limiting (not just IP-based)
   - Add CAPTCHA for sensitive operations after multiple failures

5. **Session Management**
   - Implement token refresh mechanism
   - Add token blacklisting for logout
   - Set appropriate token expiration times

6. **Data Encryption**
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest
   - Use secure key management
   - Implement field-level encryption for PII

7. **Audit Logging**
   - Log all authentication attempts
   - Track data modifications
   - Monitor suspicious activities

8. **Security Monitoring**
   - Implement intrusion detection
   - Set up security alerts
   - Regular security audits

9. **API Security**
   - Add API key authentication for third-party access
   - Implement request signing
   - Add webhook verification

10. **Dependency Security**
    - Regular npm audit
    - Automated dependency updates
    - Use tools like Snyk or Dependabot

## Security Best Practices Implemented

✅ Environment variables for sensitive data
✅ Password hashing before storage
✅ JWT for stateless authentication
✅ Role-based access control
✅ Input validation on all endpoints
✅ Rate limiting on critical routes
✅ CORS configuration
✅ Error handling without sensitive info exposure
✅ Mongoose query sanitization
✅ Protected API routes

## Recommendations for Deployment

1. **Use Environment-Specific Configurations**
   - Different JWT secrets for each environment
   - Strict CORS policy in production
   - Enable HTTPS only

2. **Database Security**
   - Use MongoDB Atlas with IP whitelisting
   - Enable authentication on MongoDB
   - Regular backups
   - Encryption at rest

3. **Server Hardening**
   - Keep Node.js and dependencies updated
   - Use process managers (PM2, Forever)
   - Implement health checks
   - Set up monitoring and alerting

4. **Secrets Management**
   - Use secret management services (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
   - Never commit secrets to repository
   - Rotate secrets regularly

5. **Network Security**
   - Use WAF (Web Application Firewall)
   - DDoS protection
   - Regular security scanning
   - Penetration testing

## Current Security Status

**Status**: ✅ Secure for Development and Testing

**Production Ready**: ⚠️ Additional hardening recommended

The current implementation provides a solid security foundation suitable for development and MVP deployment. However, before production deployment, implement the recommended additional security measures, especially:
- Enhanced rate limiting with Redis
- Helmet.js for security headers
- HTTPS enforcement
- Enhanced password policies
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Security monitoring and alerting

## Security Incident Response

In case of a security incident:
1. Immediately revoke affected JWT tokens
2. Reset database credentials
3. Analyze logs for breach scope
4. Notify affected users
5. Patch vulnerabilities
6. Document incident and response
