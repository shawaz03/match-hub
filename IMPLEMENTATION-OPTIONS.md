## 🔧 Quick Implementation Guide

Since your server is already running with the modern CSS file, you now have TWO options:

### Option A: Manual Update (Recommended for Learning)
Follow the `UI-DESIGN-GUIDE.md` and update each page yourself.
**Time**: 4-8 hours
**Benefit**: You learn the structure

### Option B: I Can Update All Files (Faster)
I can update all 10 EJS files for you with the modern UI.
**Time**: Done in minutes
**Benefit**: Faster, but you won't learn as much
